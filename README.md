# _DOUBLE_LINKED_LIST_
# Simple DOUBLE LINKED LSIT header that i created using C++
AN entire _DOUBLE_LINKED_LIST_ with all the basic features:
</br>
1. an inside class of a simple list node that has pointers to previous and next with constructors<br>
~the default </br>
~with const element</br>
~with move element</br>
~and a private constructor used to craft the object in place (see implementation)
2. an inside class of a simple iterator (pretty much a wrapper around a pointer that points to a node or to nothing nullptr),
   with the iterator you have access to change the element or to see it and advance or go backwards
   operations supported: ++,!=,==,*,+=,->,+,--,-,-= and a couple of constructors and adestructor and acopy operator and a move operator
